## What is this project about?

In this pet project I want to offer a tool to the user to create their own Haiku poems. 
The tool will help the user to use a correct number of syllabs for every verse, respecting the metric

You can try it [here](https://domenicosacco94.github.io/haiku-generator/)

## Which technologies did I use?
- **Vite** to quickly create a React based app
- **Typescript** for type checking and solid implementation of the business logic (mostly the syllable counting and the poem validation)
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **GitHub pages** for the deployment
- **Antd** and flexbox for a super-basic (but reasonably responsive) layout
