## What is this project about?

In this pet project I want to offer a tool to the user to create their own Haiku poems. 
The tool will help the user to use a correct number of syllabs for every verse, respecting the metric

## Which technologies did you decided to use?
- Vite to quickly create a React based app
- Typescript for type checking and solid implementation of the business logic (mostly the syllable counting and the poem validation)
- Vitest for unit testing
- GitHub pages for the deployment
- Antd and flexbox for a super-basic (but reasonably responsive) layout
